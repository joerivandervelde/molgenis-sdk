Protocol = CustomClass
DataSet = [DELETE/MERGE with Protocol, needs TimeStamp for Observation (?), extends other Protocol]
DataItem = FlexCol
ObservedValue = FlexColValue
Observation = Target (of FlexColValue)

Feature = keep
Target = keep
Value = keep

--> keep in mind: time series data support


1)
dataset: "reverse" link in needed!
e.g. individual: has sample? via 'sample' dataset

2)
--> special queried fields? ie. 'reverse link v2'
e.g. "how many samples in this panel", "how many individuals for which there is a DNA sample" etc...

introduce QueriedValue ?
